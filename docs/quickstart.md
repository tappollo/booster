# Quick Start

You need have node and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) install first, because we are use monorepo in our app.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tappollo/booster.git goboost
yarn install
```

!> `goboost` here is used as an example for project name, always replace `goboost` with your project name

## Initialize

To customize our project with our own project name,

```bash
./scripts/Starting_over_from_the_beginning.ts goboost
```

> It would be a good time to commit since there were a lot of changes.

## Next

Go to [Create new firebase project](firebase-configure.md).
